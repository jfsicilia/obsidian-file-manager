# File Manager Plugin for Obsidian

This plugin enhances the Obsidian File Explorer by introducing essential file management features. It adds several new commands to interact with the `File Explorer`, allowing users to bind hotkeys for efficient keyboard-only file management. 

**Version 1.2**: Introduces the new [`pathexplorer`](#pathexplorer-codeblock) codeblock. See [details](#pathexplorer-codeblock) below.

**Version 1.3**: Introduces the ability to use URL schemas as commands in `Open With...`.

**Version 1.4**: Introduces `move note` and `go to folder` commands. `Pathexplorer` can show now absolute paths and you can use environment variables in the `paths`.

## Features

-   **Open With**: Open files or folders using custom commands.
-   **Create Subfolder**: Create a subfolder within the current folder.
-   **Create Folder**: Create a sibling folder.

### Open with...

Create custom `Open With` commands in the settings tab.

**NEW:** Version 1.3.1 allows to define app URL Schemas as commands (for example: `ulysses://x-callback-url/open?path={{file_path}}`).

The `Open With` commands are also available in the File Context Menu if enabled in the settings.

### pathexplorer codeblock

Version 1.2 introduces the `pathexplorer` codeblock. For example, adding the following codeblock to a note:

````
```pathexplorer
# Path or paths to explore.
path $HOME/dev/dump_shortcuts
path c:\tools\obsidian
path %USERPROFILE%\projects

# If present include dump_shortcuts as root of files and folders. 
include-root

# Use .gitignore syntax to ignore files/folders.
ignore .git/
ignore .venv/
ignore old/
ignore build/
ignore dist/
ignore test*/
ignore __pycache__/
ignore .*
ignore *.bat
ignore *.spec

# Define max-depth (default 1)
max-depth 3

# Define max-files (default 100)
max-files 20 
```
````

Will render the following output in reader mode:

#### `pathexplorer` codeblock syntax.

> **#** 
>

>
> *Version 1.4*
>
> Now you can use environment variables in the path. The Linux/Mac format (`$<var>`) and the Windows format (`%<var>%`) can be used interchangeably. On Windows, the `HOME` environment variable will be translated to `USERPROFILE` if it does not exist.
> 
> Specify paths to explore. Multiple paths can be defined, one per line.
> 
> **include-root**
>
> Include the root folder as the parent of its children.
>

>
> Max depth level to explore in the tree.
>
> **max-files**
>
> Max number of files/folders to display.
>
> **ignore**
>
> Ignore files/folders using `.gitignore` patterns. Inverted patterns (`!<pattern>`) are also supported.  Multiple ignore patterns can be defined, one per line.
>
